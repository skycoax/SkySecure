"""
Store-readiness checks for Humogram.

WHY THIS EXISTS

A Play policy review found sixteen blocking problems in this fork, and every
one of them was invisible to the compiler. The build was green while the chat
list was headed by Telegram's registered wordmark, while READ_CALL_LOG shipped
in the release manifest, and while the screen carrying the unofficial-app
disclosure, the GPL source offer and the privacy policy was declared and never
opened from anywhere.

That class of defect does not come back through testing, because there is
nothing to test: the app behaves exactly as written. It comes back through a
merge, an upstream rebase, or somebody restoring a file. So the findings are
written down here as executable assertions.

WHAT IT IS NOT

Not a substitute for reading the policies. It encodes the specific mistakes
this codebase actually made, which is a much narrower thing than "the app
complies with Google Play". A green run means these particular regressions have
not returned.

The same goes for what we declared in Play Console. The content rating was
rejected because the questionnaire described an app the code had outgrown, and
the target API and Billing Library deadlines passed with nothing in the build
that knew about them. docs/play-console.md records the declarations; the checks
below hold the code to them and to Google's yearly minimums.

RUN

    python tools/play_policy_check.py

Exit code 0 if every check passes, 1 otherwise. Warnings (a Play deadline that
is coming up) print but do not fail. No dependencies, so it runs in CI, in a git
hook, or by hand; every release build runs it too (see build.gradle).
