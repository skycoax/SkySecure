/**
 * The siren that plays when a dangerous file is about to be opened.
 *
 * <h3>What this is for</h3>
 *
 * One sound, one meaning: "you are about to do the thing this product exists
 * to stop". It fires when a warning dialog goes up in front of a dangerous or
 * unchecked installer — not for verdicts, not for downloads, not for anything
 * the user is merely looking at. A sound that plays often is a sound people
 * learn to ignore, and the population this app is built for is exactly the one
 * that taps through visual warnings; the siren is the channel that still works
 * when the eyes have already decided.
 *
 * <h3>The asset and its fallback</h3>
 *
 * {@code res/raw/jac_alarm.wav} is a short synthesised hi-lo two-tone —
 * unambiguous as an alert and unlike every sound Telegram itself makes, so it
 * cannot be mistaken for a message arriving. It is played through
 * {@link SoundPool} on {@link AudioManager#STREAM_ALARM}: the stream the
 * platform reserves for "needs attention now", which is not silenced by the
 * media volume being at zero.
 *
 * <p>A missing or undecodable asset must not mean silence — silence here is a
 * safety regression, not a cosmetic one. If the sample fails to load, the
 * fallback is a {@link ToneGenerator} burst on the same stream: built into the
 * platform, no asset to lose, works since API 1.
 *
 * <h3>Silent mode</h3>
 *
 * {@code RINGER_MODE_SILENT} is respected for the sound and answered with
 * vibration instead; {@code RINGER_MODE_VIBRATE} gets both suppressed audio
 * and the vibration it asked for. A security alert that overrides an explicit
 * "be quiet" from the user would spend the product's credibility on one
 * moment of drama — and the dialog with its countdown is still in the way
 * either way.
 *
 * <h3>Lifetime</h3>
 *
 * The pool is created lazily and kept for the life of the process, the same
 * way {@code NotificationsController} keeps its message-sound pool: one
 * decoded 46 KB sample is cheaper than a create/release race on every dialog.
 * Everything is wrapped and best-effort — an alarm that cannot sound must
 * never take the warning dialog down with it.
